# Source Map

This page maps the `/src` tree to the subsystems it owns. It is organized by
responsibility, not as a file listing: each subsystem gets a one-line role and
its principal entry file(s). Use it to find where a concern lives before diving
into a subsystem's own page.

Related reading: [architecture overview](/openwiki/architecture/overview.md),
[agent runtime](/openwiki/architecture/agent-runtime.md),
[grounded claims](/openwiki/concepts/grounded-claims.md),
[repository generation](/openwiki/workflows/repository-generation.md),
[connectors](/openwiki/integrations/connectors.md), and
[evaluation subsystem](/openwiki/testing/evals.md).

## The central files

Three files carry a disproportionate share of the system and are worth knowing
before anything else.

- **`src/agent/index.ts`** (the largest source file) owns the LLM agent surface.
  It builds and runs the OpenWiki agent (`runOpenWikiAgent`,
  `createOpenWikiAgent`), resolves and constructs the chat model across every
  supported provider (`resolveModelId`, `createModel`), manages the LangGraph
  checkpoint thread and its history (`createOpenWikiThreadId`,
  `pruneCheckpointHistory`, `resolveCheckpointTarget`), and parses streamed
  agent events into `OpenWikiRunEvent`s (`parseStreamEvent`,
  `parseAgentStreamChunk`, and the `parseUpdatesChunk` helper it dispatches to
  for `'updates'`-mode LangGraph state-delta chunks, which extracts the first
  non-empty assistant text from the per-node output objects). While streaming,
  `parseAgentStreamChunk` suppresses content blocks whose `type` includes
  `file` or `image` (notably `file`, `input_file`, and `image_url` base64
  blobs) so they never reach the terminal — behavior pinned by
  `test/agent/stream-redaction.test.ts`.
- **`src/config/constants.ts`** is the single large registry of stable strings:
  the `openwiki` directory name and the page-manifest/update-metadata paths, plus
  the provider environment-variable key names and defaults for every supported
  provider (`OPENAI_API_KEY_ENV_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY_ENV_KEY`, Bedrock/Vertex,
  Gemini, OpenRouter, Baseten, Copilot, Fireworks, Nebius, NVIDIA, the IBM Bob
  keys (`BOB_API_KEY_ENV_KEY`, `BOB_BASE_URL_ENV_KEY`), the `openai-compatible`
  keys — including the `OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_STREAM_MESSAGES_ENV_KEY` and
  `OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_REASONING_EFFORT_SUPPORTED_ENV_KEY` gates — and the
  connector OAuth keys) and the `OpenWikiProvider` union (which includes the
  `bob` provider). It also owns the output-token ceilings:
  `resolveConfiguredMaxOutputTokens` picks the right provider-specific setting
  (OpenRouter's legacy `OPENWIKI_OPENROUTER_MAX_TOKENS` first, then
  `OPENWIKI_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS`), and `resolveBedrockMaxTokens` falls back to
  `BEDROCK_DEFAULT_MAX_TOKENS` (16000) so Bedrock's 4096-token default does not
  truncate long pages. It additionally gates reasoning effort and stream mode
  for `openai-compatible` providers: it exports
  `OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_REASONING_EFFORT_SUPPORTED_ENV_KEY` and
  `resolveOpenAiCompatibleReasoningEffortSupported`, which `reasoning.ts` consults
  to decide whether an `openai-compatible` model advertises a reasoning
  capability, `providerUsesResponsesApi`, which selects the
  `responses-reasoning` vs `chat-completions-reasoning-effort` transport, and
  `resolveOpenAiCompatibleStreamMessages` (the
  `OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_STREAM_MESSAGES_ENV_KEY` resolver), which opts an
  `openai-compatible` endpoint back into LangGraph's `"messages"` stream mode.
  Nearly every subsystem imports its identifiers from here.
- **`src/generation/repository-run.ts`** owns the repository-generation
  lifecycle. It drives the plan-then-page workflow across a six-operation
  surface: `beginRepositoryRun`, `submitRepositoryPlan`, `nextRepositoryPage`,
  `inspectRepositoryPageClaims`, `submitRepositoryPage`, and
  `finishRepositoryRun`, wiring together the run state, claims runtime, wiki
  finalizer, and OKF frontmatter validation — including deterministic
  frontmatter repair (`repairPersistedFile`) before a page job is accepted.
  `beginRepositoryRun` resolves the requested language up front
  (`resolveLanguage`) and rejects an unrecognized language with
  `invalid_input` rather than falling back to English, since run state cannot
  change its language after a start. `nextRepositoryPage` returns the first
  non-excluded pending job plus its `existingClaimCount` and only the
  `claimsRequiringAttention` (Claims carrying a stale or unresolved issue), so
  focused updates need not re-emit issue-free Claims; it accepts an `exclude`
  set of already-claimed job ids so several workers can own distinct pending
  jobs at once, and ownership stays process-local so the durable checkpoint
  only records `pending`/`skipped`/`complete`. `inspectRepositoryPageClaims`
  exposes the page's complete compact Claim set on demand for workers that
  intend to revise or remove otherwise-current content. `submitRepositoryPage`
  takes sparse Claim decisions (`confirmedClaimIds`/`claims`/`retractedClaimIds`)
  which `reconcilePageClaims` turns into confirm/update/add/retract operations,
  retaining omitted issue-free Claims. The shared-state mutations of
  `submitRepositoryPage` and `skipRepositoryPage` run under `withRunMutation`, a
  per-run promise chain keyed by object identity, so concurrent workers never
  lose a completion while the model-owned work stays outside the lock. It also
  owns the skip-failed-page-workers path: `captureRepositoryPageSnapshot` records
  the pending page and its claims sidecar before a worker runs,
  `skipRepositoryPage` rolls a failed worker back (restoring the page markdown
  and sidecar, marking the job `skipped`), and
  `restoreRepositoryPageMarkdown` re-applies the snapshot during
  `finishRepositoryRun` for every skipped job, tolerating a not-found page when
  the snapshot recorded no markdown.

## Subsystems

### agent — LLM agent construction and repository authoring loop

Owns model/provider wiring, the agent tool loop, and the machinery that turns a
run into wiki pages. Principal entry: `src/agent/index.ts`. Supporting owners
include `src/agent/repository-runner.ts` — the **native** plan/page tool loop that
calls into `generation/repository-run.ts`, and the in-process counterpart to the
**host-driven** `integrations/core/session-manager.ts` adapter (both drive the same
six-operation lifecycle, but the runner owns a bounded page-worker pool and emits
`RepositoryGenerationProgressEvent`s while the session manager exposes the lifecycle
as MCP tools one operation at a time). `src/agent/types.ts` owns the
`OpenWikiRunEvent` union consumed by the CLI, including
`RepositoryGenerationProgressEvent` (with `stage`, `page`/`pageIndex`/`pageCount`,
`completedCount`, and `inFlightPages` for the concurrent pool). `src/agent/utils.ts`
(run-context construction, content/source snapshots, and update-metadata
persistence shared by the generation lifecycle), `src/agent/docs-only-backend.ts`
(the sandboxed shell/filesystem backend), the OKF and translation middleware
(`okf-middleware.ts`, `translation-middleware.ts`), the prompt builders
(`prompt.ts`, `repository-prompts.ts`), read-boundary enforcement
(`openwiki-ignore.ts`), wiki post-processing (`wiki-finalizer.ts`,
`wiki-link-validator.ts`, `wiki-replacement.ts`), and the ChatGPT/Vertex auth
surfaces (`openai-chatgpt-oauth.ts`, `vertex-surface.ts`), and the IBM Bob fetch
adapter (`bob.ts`, whose `createBobFetch` rewrites `Authorization: Bearer …` to
`Apikey <key>` and sets the `ibm-bob-openwiki-provider` `User-Agent` required by
Bob's Cloudflare WAF — wired into `createModel`'s `bob` branch).
`runNativeRepositoryGeneration` drives the full loop: it begins the run, runs the
planning agent, then calls `runPendingPageAgents` to document every pending
page with fresh shell-free workers, emitting `repository_progress` events at each
stage (`noop`, `planning`, `generating`, `finalizing`); the `generating` event from
`emitGeneratingProgress` reports the focused page's position plus, when more than
one worker is configured, the `completedCount` and the `inFlightPages` list. Each
`runPageAgent` worker is given an `inspect_claims` tool (backing
`inspectRepositoryPageClaims`) and a `submit_page` tool (backing the sparse
`submitRepositoryPage`); it captures a `RepositoryPageSnapshot` via
`captureRepositoryPageSnapshot` before any model work, and on a worker that exits
without submitting it calls `skipRepositoryPage` to restore the page and mark it
`skipped`, collecting the snapshots and passing them to `finishRepositoryRun` so
skipped pages keep their pre-work content and are reconsidered on the next update.

`runPendingPageAgents` runs an in-process page-worker pool rather than a single
sequential worker. The pool size is the resolved `OPENWIKI_PAGE_CONCURRENCY`
(between `DEFAULT_PAGE_CONCURRENCY` of 1 and the `MAX_PAGE_CONCURRENCY` cap of
8); the CLI resolves it via `resolvePageConcurrency` in `config/constants.ts`
and threads it through `runNativeRepositoryGeneration`. The pool is
process-local bookkeeping (a `PageWorkerPool` of claimed jobs, in-flight pages,
a live worker limit, and skipped snapshots) — the durable checkpoint never
records who owns a pending job, so a resumed run rebuilds ownership from
scratch. `acquireNextJob` serializes job selection so two loops never claim the
same pending job (passing already-claimed ids as `exclude` to
`nextRepositoryPage`). With more than one worker the quickstart page is held
back to a final single-worker pass so its task-routing map links to pages that
already exist. The shared-state mutations of `submitRepositoryPage` and
`skipRepositoryPage` run under `withRunMutation`, a per-run promise chain keyed
by object identity, so concurrent workers never lose a completion while the
model-owned work stays outside the lock. A worker that fails on a provider rate
limit (`isRateLimitError`) lowers the live pool size by one, never below 1; a
fatal submission error stops new work but lets in-flight workers submit or
skip, then rethrows before `finishRepositoryRun` so a run never finalizes with
pending jobs.

### generation — repository run lifecycle and page jobs

Orchestrates a full repository wiki build. Principal entry:
`src/generation/repository-run.ts`, which imports `resolveLanguage`/
`requireResolvedLanguage` from `platform/language.ts` so `beginRepositoryRun`
can reject an unrecognized language before any run state is written.
`src/generation/run-state.ts` owns the durable on-disk checkpoint (`.run.json`,
schema-versioned, with `planning`/`generating` phases and `pending`/`skipped`/
`complete` page-job statuses) so runs resume after interruption.
`src/generation/page-jobs.ts` builds the plan (`createRepositoryPlan`) and
reconciles per-page Claims (`reconcilePageClaims`), turning sparse
`confirmedClaimIds`/`claims`/`retractedClaimIds` decisions into
confirm/update/add/retract operations while retaining omitted issue-free
Claims. `src/generation/page-manifest.ts`
owns the committed page-correctness ledger (`openwiki/.page-manifest.json`,
schema-versioned), recording each completed page's source fingerprint, page
version, and producer provenance. `src/generation/errors.ts` defines
`RepositoryRunError`. The lifecycle exposes a six-operation surface
(`beginRepositoryRun`, `submitRepositoryPlan`, `nextRepositoryPage`,
`inspectRepositoryPageClaims`, `submitRepositoryPage`, `finishRepositoryRun`).
`nextRepositoryPage` returns `claimsRequiringAttention` and
`existingClaimCount` rather than the full Claim set; `inspectRepositoryPageClaims`
returns the complete compact Claim set on demand. Its snapshot/skip/restore
operations (`captureRepositoryPageSnapshot`, `skipRepositoryPage`,
`restoreRepositoryPageMarkdown`) let a failed page worker be rolled back to its
pre-work state and marked `skipped` rather than failing the whole run;
`restoreRepositoryPageMarkdown` tolerates a not-found page when the snapshot
held no markdown, so deleting a newly added page counts as a clean restore;
`finishRepositoryRun` requires a snapshot for every skipped job and re-applies
those snapshots before finalizing.

### claims — grounded-claim persistence, reconciliation guidance, and evidence resolution

Owns the grounded-claims model: strict per-page claim sidecars and the evidence
that backs them. `src/claims/brains/code/runtime.ts` (`prepareClaimsRuntime`)
assembles process-local claims state used by a repository run;
`src/claims/brains/code/store.ts` (`ClaimsStore`) validates and persists claim
sidecars with a schema version; `session.ts` inspects and replaces page claims;
`preflight.ts` computes stable grounding issues. `src/claims/core/` holds
mutations, error types, and the resolver cache. `src/claims/evidence/repository/`
resolves and relocates `repo://` evidence resources (`resolver.ts`,
`resource.ts`), including opaque line-range relocation metadata.
`src/claims/guidance.ts` is the shared model-facing Claims standard: it exports
`CLAIMS_SUBSTANCE_GUIDANCE` (the rules for selecting substantive, atomic
propositions over shallow per-symbol facts) and `CLAIMS_RECONCILIATION_GUIDANCE`
(the sparse-reconciliation rules), consumed verbatim by the page-worker prompt
(`repository-prompts.ts`), the `submit_page` tool description, and the MCP
server `INSTRUCTIONS` so the model sees one standard across every surface.

### okf — Open Knowledge Format frontmatter, indexing, and verification

Owns OKF concept-page structure. `src/okf/frontmatter.ts` is the principal
entry: it validates OKF frontmatter (`validateOkfFrontmatter`), including the
OKF v0.2 trust families — `generated`, `verified`, `sources`, `status`, and
`stale_after` — via `validateTrustFamilies`. It reads and writes individual
fields while preserving unrelated front-matter lines byte-for-byte
(`parseFrontmatterFields`, `readFrontmatterField`, `setFrontmatterField`), and
stamps producer-owned control fields (`setGeneratedEvent`, `setOkfSources`,
`setOkfVerified`). It also deterministically repairs persisted pages
(`repairOkfFrontmatter`, `repairPersistedFile`), which the repository lifecycle
calls before accepting a page. `index-sync.ts` and `index-labels.ts` keep index
pages and concept-type labels in sync; `claims-verification.ts` synchronizes
and rolls back claim verification; `generated-provenance.ts` and
`claim-sources.ts` handle provenance metadata.

### connectors — external read-only knowledge sources

Owns the built-in source connectors and their MCP plumbing.
`src/connectors/registry.ts` (`createConnectorRegistry`, `CONNECTOR_IDS`) is the
central registry mapping ids (`git-repo`, `slack`, `x`, `google`, `web-search`,
`hackernews`, `langsmith`, `notion`, `custom-mcp`) to runtimes. `tools.ts`
exposes connectors to the agent as tools; `mcp-client.ts` and `mcp-runtime.ts`
run MCP transports; `src/connectors/sources/` holds one file per connector
implementation.

### ingestion — pulling connector content into the wiki

Owns the ingestion command that fetches from configured connectors and feeds the
generation pipeline. Principal entry: `src/ingestion/ingestion.ts`
(`runOpenWikiIngestion`). `src/ingestion/code-mode.ts` prepares repository
("code mode") setup consumed by repository runs.

### retrieval — read-only repository wiki search and section reads

Owns the transport-independent repository wiki retrieval backing the MCP
read-only tools. Principal entry: `src/retrieval/wiki.ts`, which exports
`searchWiki` (ranked compact section references, with bounded query/path/limit
validation via `WIKI_RETRIEVAL_LIMITS`) and `readWikiSections` (exact Markdown
sections selected from search refs). It consumes the OKF frontmatter reader,
the claims store for page grounding, and the `linking/` subsystem for workspace
resolution; both functions are called by `integrations/core/retrieval-tools.ts`.

### linking — named wiki workspaces

Owns named workspaces of related repository wikis and the active-workspace
selection that resolves search overlaps. Principal entry:
`src/linking/wiki-workspaces.ts`, which persists the schema-versioned
`wiki-workspaces.json` registry (capped wiki/workspace counts and registry size),
discovers reachable wikis by directory depth, and exposes `listWikiWorkspaces`,
`listWorkspaceWikis`, `searchWiki`-style workspace resolution, and the active
workspace get/set/clear operations. The `cli/link.tsx` command and the
`retrieval/` and `integrations/core/retrieval-tools.ts` surfaces all depend on
it.

### cli — command parsing and terminal UI

Owns the executable entrypoint and terminal experience. `src/cli/cli.tsx` is the
`#!/usr/bin/env node` entry that installs the crash guard, parses the command, and
dispatches: host-integration and MCP commands route to their own runners
(`integrations.ts`, `link.tsx`), while standard commands flow through
`runStandardCommand`, which loads the OpenWiki environment (`commandLoadsEnvironment`),
resolves startup validation (`startup.ts`'s `resolveStartupCommand`, which rejects
non-interactive runs missing credentials and empty messages), and then branches to
the Ink app, a non-interactive print runner (`run-mode.ts`'s
`shouldRunNonInteractively`/`shouldPrintStartupError`), or per-command handlers in
`runners.ts`. `src/cli/commands.ts` is the large command parser/router
(`parseCommand`, and predicates such as `commandLoadsEnvironment`,
`commandEmitsTelemetry`, and `shouldRunNonInteractively`). `runners.ts` hosts
per-command handlers; `app/`, `components/`, and `input/` hold the Ink UI. The
`run-log/` directory owns the live run-progress model folded from
`OpenWikiRunEvent`s: `reducer.ts` (`appendRunLogEvent`) folds a run event into a
bounded progress model (main-agent prose as one replaceable buffer, subgraph prose
discarded, filesystem tools as exact path activity), `types.ts` defines the log
items (including `RunRepositoryProgressLogItem` carrying `inFlightPages`,
`completedCount`, and stage/page counters), and `activity.ts`, `summary.ts`, and
`tool-input.ts` derive the activity tree and run counts.

### auth — provider and OAuth credential management

Owns credential acquisition and storage. Principal entries: `src/auth/oauth.ts`
(OAuth flows) and `src/auth/tokens.ts` (token persistence), with
`oauth-discovery.ts`, `providers.ts`, `configure.ts`, `external-cli-auth.ts`, and
`ngrok.ts` for discovery, provider selection, and tunneling.

### setup — interactive onboarding and first-run credential configuration

Owns the guided setup flow. Principal entry: `src/setup/onboarding.ts`, which
reads and writes the `~/.openwiki/onboarding.json` state (connected sources,
their schedules, and power-management settings) and the home
`INSTRUCTIONS.md`. `src/setup/credentials/` holds the provider-credential setup
steps (`steps.ts`), persistence (`persistence.ts`), and formatting
(`format.ts`), reading provider key/region/model requirements from
`config/constants.ts` and the reasoning capability from `config/reasoning.ts`.

### config — environment, home directory, reasoning, and constants

Owns runtime configuration. `src/config/constants.ts` is the central identifier
registry (path constants, provider env keys — including the IBM Bob
`BOB_API_KEY_ENV_KEY`/`BOB_BASE_URL_ENV_KEY`, the `bob` provider in the
`OpenWikiProvider` union, and the `openai-compatible` streaming/responses-API
gates plus `OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_STREAM_MESSAGES_ENV_KEY` and
`OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_REASONING_EFFORT_SUPPORTED_ENV_KEY` — provider defaults), and
also owns the output-token resolution helpers
(`resolveConfiguredMaxOutputTokens`, `resolveBedrockMaxTokens`,
`BEDROCK_DEFAULT_MAX_TOKENS`) plus `resolveOpenAiCompatibleReasoningEffortSupported`,
`resolveOpenAiCompatibleStreamMessages`, and `providerUsesResponsesApi`, which
gate reasoning effort, stream mode, and the responses API transport for
`openai-compatible` providers; it also resolves page-worker concurrency
(`resolvePageConcurrency`, reading `OPENWIKI_PAGE_CONCURRENCY` between
`DEFAULT_PAGE_CONCURRENCY` of 1 and the `MAX_PAGE_CONCURRENCY` cap of 8) and
the provider retry count (`resolveProviderRetryAttempts`, which raises the
default from `DEFAULT_PROVIDER_RETRY_ATTEMPTS` to
`PARALLEL_PROVIDER_RETRY_ATTEMPTS` when more than one worker runs, since
concurrent workers make transient rate limits the common failure). `env.ts`
loads and saves the OpenWiki `.env` and
is the single source of truth for the managed-keys list (`MANAGED_ENV_KEYS`,
now including `BOB_API_KEY_ENV_KEY`, `BOB_BASE_URL_ENV_KEY`,
`OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_STREAM_MESSAGES_ENV_KEY`, and
`OPENWIKI_OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_REASONING_EFFORT_SUPPORTED`), from which the
credential-diagnostic and debug key lists derive; `openwiki-home.ts` resolves the
home/wiki directories; `reasoning.ts` resolves reasoning settings, owning the
three reasoning transports (`responses-reasoning`,
`chat-completions-reasoning-effort`, `gemini-thinking-level`) and the
`openai-compatible` capability resolution that consults
`resolveOpenAiCompatibleReasoningEffortSupported` and
`providerUsesResponsesApi` from `constants.ts`.

### integrations — host-tool integration and MCP server surface

Owns embedding OpenWiki into external hosts. `src/integrations/core/session-manager.ts`
is the principal entry and the host-driven counterpart to the native
`agent/repository-runner.ts`: `HostSessionManager` is a thin single-run MCP adapter
over the transport-neutral lifecycle core, serializing one lifecycle operation at a
time (`runOperation`, which rejects a concurrent operation with `invalid_state` and
maps `RepositoryRunError` codes into stable `HostIntegrationError`s at the
boundary). Its `begin`, `submitPlan`, `nextPage`, `inspectPageClaims`,
`submitPage`, and `finish` methods delegate to the `generation/repository-run.ts`
lifecycle, while `tools()` returns the read-only retrieval tools first followed by
the six OpenWiki lifecycle tools (`openwiki_begin`, `openwiki_submit_plan`,
`openwiki_next_page`, `openwiki_inspect_page_claims`, `openwiki_submit_page`,
`openwiki_finish`) for an MCP transport to expose. The lifecycle tool descriptions
are the host-facing contract: `openwiki_begin` advertises that an unrecognized
`language` returns `invalid_input` instead of starting a run, `openwiki_next_page`
returns only the stale or unresolved Claims requiring an explicit decision (plus
an `existingClaimCount`), `openwiki_inspect_page_claims` returns the complete
Claim set on demand, `openwiki_submit_page` states the sparse
Claim-reconciliation rules (reuse ids for revisions, omit to retain, omit id for
new, `retractedClaimIds` for removals), and `openwiki_finish` requires every job
complete before deterministic deletion/validation/indexing.
`src/integrations/core/protocol.ts` defines the `ProtocolToolName` union — all
ten tool names: the four read-only retrieval tools (`openwiki_list_workspaces`,
`openwiki_list_wikis`, `openwiki_search`, `openwiki_read`) plus the six lifecycle
tools — the strict Zod input schemas including the sparse `SubmitPageInput`
(optional `confirmedClaimIds`, `claims`, and `retractedClaimIds`) and
`InspectPageClaimsInput`, and host-id validation (`isValidHostId` against a
lowercase/digit/hyphen pattern). The retrieval tools themselves are built by
`retrieval-tools.ts` (`createRetrievalTools`), which delegates to the
`retrieval/` and `linking/` subsystems; `repository-root.ts` resolves the
repository root. `src/integrations/mcp/server.ts` exposes OpenWiki over MCP,
advertising an `INSTRUCTIONS` preamble that incorporates
`CLAIMS_RECONCILIATION_GUIDANCE` from `claims/guidance.ts` so the host model
follows the same sparse-reconciliation standard as the native page-worker prompt
(stdio in `stdio.ts`); `src/integrations/install/` handles host installation.

### visualize — local graph viewer

Owns the interactive wiki/graph viewer. `src/visualize/server.ts`
(`createRequestHandler`) serves the app; `graph.ts` builds the graph model;
`page.ts`, `client.ts`, `client-lib.ts`, and `static-export.ts` render and export
it.

### scheduling — recurring connector and generation runs

Owns cron/launchd scheduling. Principal entry: `src/scheduling/schedules.ts`,
which validates cron expressions and installs, lists, pauses, resumes, and
deletes connector and "power" schedules.

### telemetry — run recording and error classification

Owns opt-out usage telemetry and error taxonomy. `src/telemetry/index.ts` is the
public barrel re-exporting `recordRun`/`recordRunSafe`, `withRunTelemetry`,
error classification (`classifyError`, `tagErrorStage`), and the opt-out gates
(`isTelemetryDisabled`, `isCiEnvironment`). `senders.ts`, `errors.ts`, and
`taxonomy.ts` carry the implementation.

### platform — OS and filesystem primitives

Owns cross-platform helpers shared by other subsystems: `fs-errors.ts`
(`isFileNotFoundError`), `diagnostics.ts` (secret redaction), `language.ts`
(language resolution), `windows-acl.ts`, and `utils.ts`.

### mermaid — diagram validation for generated pages

Owns Mermaid handling in generated wikis: `fences.ts` extracts fences,
`validate.ts` parses/validates them (degrading invalid diagrams), `wiki.ts`
applies the policy to pages, and `dom-shim.ts` provides the headless render
environment.

### evals — longitudinal documentation evaluation

Owns the offline evaluation harnesses that measure whether generated wikis stay
accurate as their source of truth evolves, and whether OpenWiki improves a
coding agent. Unlike every other subsystem, the evals live under `evals/`
(not `src/`) and are invoked via `pnpm` scripts — `eval:ledger` and
`eval:ledger:reevaluate` — rather than the main CLI binary, with their own
TypeScript project (`evals/ledger/tsconfig.json`). It is split into two
independent sub-harnesses.

**LEDGER** (`evals/ledger/`) — the Longitudinal Evaluation of Documentation
Grounding, Evolution, and Revision — replays a benchmark's Git checkpoints, runs
OpenWiki at each checkpoint, and judges the frozen wiki snapshot. Principal
entry: `evals/ledger/run.ts` (`eval:ledger`), which loads the benchmark,
constructs the `OpenWikiSystem` adapter, runs `runBenchmark`, and persists the
fully auditable result. `evals/ledger/reevaluate.ts` (`eval:ledger:reevaluate`)
re-runs the evaluator over a completed run without invoking the system under
test. `evals/ledger/run/runner.ts` (`runBenchmark`) owns the benchmark
lifecycle: it preflight-validates the trace (every checkpoint SHA resolves,
each is an ancestor of the next, and none tracks the wiki directory), then
walks it running `init` then `update`, captures an immutable artifact at each
checkpoint, and evaluates it; the workspace and worktree are always torn down.
`evals/ledger/core/types.ts` owns the benchmark and claim types
(`LedgerBenchmark`, `LedgerTrace`, `LedgerCheckpoint`, `SemanticEvidenceMap`,
`KnowledgeArtifact`, `EvidenceCorpus`, `SystemUnderTest`) and the claim-state
model (`supported`/`stale`/`invented`/`unverified`). `evals/ledger/system/openwiki-system.ts`
(`OpenWikiSystem`) is the baseline System Under Test: it drives OpenWiki through
its single `runOpenWikiAgent` entrypoint with `outputMode: "repository"` and no
user message, so update change-detection is driven purely by the real source
deltas between checkpoints.

**DeepSWE** (`evals/deepswe/`) is a Python paired-evaluation harness that
measures whether OpenWiki improves a coding agent on DeepSWE SWE-bench tasks.
Principal entry: `evals/deepswe/run.py`, which exposes the `prepare`,
`baseline`, `openwiki`, `paired`, and `summarize` subcommands. The `paired`
command runs both conditions with the same tasks, seed, model, reasoning effort,
and Harbor environment: `baseline` gives Codex only the task and repository,
while `openwiki` restores or generates OpenWiki in an isolated clone and merges
its managed instructions into the root `AGENTS.md` before the same Codex adapter
solves the unchanged task. The harness pins the DeepSWE commit, Harbor, litellm,
and Codex CLI versions for reproducibility, and uses Harbor's official LangSmith
plugin so both conditions record their trials in the same shared dataset.

See the full [evaluation subsystem](/openwiki/testing/evals.md) page for the
benchmark contract, claim-state definitions, and run instructions.

## How the central subsystems connect

The CLI entrypoint parses a command and, for repository generation, the agent
constructs a model, resolves page-worker concurrency, and runs the plan/page
loop through a bounded in-process worker pool, which calls the generation
lifecycle; that lifecycle serializes only shared-state mutations
(`withRunMutation`), reconciles sparse Claim decisions, persists claims, and
validates OKF frontmatter as it writes each page. The same six-operation
lifecycle is exposed to external hosts through `integrations/core/session-manager.ts`
(as MCP tools, one operation at a time) — the host-driven counterpart to the native
`agent/repository-runner.ts` worker pool. Both the native page-worker prompt and
the MCP host instructions share the same Claims reconciliation guidance from
`claims/guidance.ts`, and the MCP retrieval tools (`openwiki_search`,
`openwiki_read`, `openwiki_list_workspaces`, `openwiki_list_wikis`) delegate to
`retrieval/wiki.ts` and `linking/wiki-workspaces.ts`.

Caption: Control flow from the CLI through the agent into the repository
generation lifecycle, with the shared Claims guidance feeding both the native
page-worker prompt and the MCP host instructions. The agent threads the
resolved page-worker concurrency into the runner, whose pool claims distinct
pending jobs (excluding in-flight ids); only the shared-state mutations inside
the lifecycle are serialized by `withRunMutation`, while model-owned work runs
outside the lock. The native runner and the host session manager are two
counterpart fronts over the same lifecycle: the runner owns a bounded worker
pool and emits progress events, while the session manager exposes the lifecycle
as MCP tools one operation at a time.

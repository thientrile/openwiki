# Configuration and Environment

OpenWiki is configured almost entirely through environment variables. Provider
credentials, model selection, token limits, streaming toggles, and reasoning
effort are all read from `process.env`, with a persisted fallback file at
`~/.openwiki/.env`. This page describes where that state lives, how values are
loaded and saved, the precedence between the shell and the saved file, how
secrets are sanitized, and the key settings a reader needs to operate OpenWiki.

Related reading: [Model providers](../concepts/model-providers.md),
[CLI reference](./cli-reference.md), and [Onboarding](../workflows/onboarding.md).

## The state directory

All persistent OpenWiki state lives under a single home directory, resolved by
`resolveOpenWikiHomeDir`. By default this is `~/.openwiki`
(`path.join(os.homedir(), ".openwiki")`), but it can be relocated with the
`OPENWIKI_CONFIG_DIR` environment variable. A configured directory is
tilde-expanded manually (because `path.resolve` does not expand a leading `~`)
so values like `~/custom` that come from PowerShell, docker-compose, or a
hand-edited `.env` resolve correctly.

`ensureOpenWikiHome` creates the home directory and its subdirectories —
`connectors`, `conversation_history`, `wiki`, and `skills` — each with owner-only
`0o700` permissions. The persisted environment file lives at
`<home>/.env` (`openWikiEnvPath`), displayed to users as `~/.openwiki/.env`.

### Windows ACL handling

POSIX `0o700` intent does not translate to Windows, where `fs.chmod` only toggles
the read-only attribute and leaves ACLs untouched. To preserve owner-only access
on Windows, directory creation runs `restrictDirToCurrentUser`, which uses
`icacls` to grant full control to the current user and the well-known SYSTEM SID
(`*S-1-5-18`, referenced by SID so it resolves regardless of display language),
then removes inherited ACEs. The grant runs before the inheritance reset so a
failed grant can never lock the user out of the directory. It is best-effort by
design: it returns `false` instead of throwing so ACL tooling problems never
block a run, and it is a no-op on non-Windows platforms.

## Managed keys as the single source of truth

`MANAGED_ENV_KEYS` in `src/config/env.ts` lists every environment variable
OpenWiki reads or persists, in the exact order they are written to
`~/.openwiki/.env`. It is the single source of truth: both the credential
diagnostics list (`CREDENTIAL_DIAGNOSTIC_ENV_KEYS`) and the agent's debug-dump
key list (`DEBUG_ENV_KEYS`) are derived from it by filtering, so they cannot
silently drift out of sync when a new managed key is added — including the
newer `OPENWIKI_PAGE_CONCURRENCY` key, which sits alongside
`OPENWIKI_PROVIDER_RETRY_ATTEMPTS` in the managed list. LangChain
project/tracing settings are managed but are not credentials, so they are
excluded from the diagnostics panel via `NON_CREDENTIAL_ENV_KEYS`.

## Loading and precedence

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A["loadOpenWikiEnv"] --> B["captureShellEnv snapshot"]
  B --> C["readOpenWikiEnv from ~/.openwiki/.env"]
  C --> D["record savedEnvAtStartup on first load"]
  D --> E{"process.env already set for key"}
  E -- yes --> F["keep shell value"]
  E -- no --> G["seed process.env from saved file"]
```

Precedence when OpenWiki loads its persisted environment file.

`loadOpenWikiEnv` reads `~/.openwiki/.env` and copies each value into
`process.env` only when that key is not already set. This makes a shell export
win over the saved file at runtime: OpenWiki never overwrites a variable the user
exported in their shell. Deprecated keys (`OPENAI_ORG_ID`, `OPENAI_PROJECT`) are
skipped on load. Reading a non-existent file is not an error — `readOpenWikiEnv`
returns an empty map when the file is missing.

To reason about this precedence, OpenWiki captures two in-memory snapshots at
startup, both held in memory only and never persisted or logged:

- `captureShellEnv` records the shell's values for managed credential keys before
  any load or save wrote to `process.env`. It is idempotent — the first call
  wins — so a later load or save cannot capture values OpenWiki itself seeded.
  `getShellEnvValue` exposes this snapshot.
- `savedEnvAtStartup` records the file's values as of the first load, exposed via
  `getSavedEnvValue`. This lets the setup wizard pre-fill fields from the saved
  config rather than `process.env` (which a shell var may shadow), so editing
  config never accidentally captures a shell override.

## Saving: serialized, atomic, and shell-aware

`saveOpenWikiEnv` serializes all writes through a promise queue
(`saveOpenWikiEnvQueue`) so concurrent saves cannot interleave; a failed save is
swallowed in the queue chain so it does not permanently block later saves, while
the original caller still receives the error.

The locked save (`saveOpenWikiEnvLocked`) merges updates over the current file
contents, drops deprecated keys, and drops any key whose value is empty — an
empty value means "not set", so persisting `KEY=""` (which would later read back
as configured) is avoided, and this also self-heals empty values left by earlier
writes. It then ensures the directory exists with `0o700`, re-applies the mode,
and calls `restrictDirToCurrentUser`.

Writes are atomic: the new contents are written to a uniquely named temp file in
the same directory (mode `0o600`) and then `rename`d into place. A plain
`writeFile` would open the existing credential file with `O_TRUNC`, so a failure
mid-write (ENOSPC, crash, power loss) would truncate `~/.openwiki/.env` and lose
every saved token and key; the rename keeps the original intact until the new
contents are fully written.

After writing the file, `process.env` is updated to mirror the save — but a key
whose value came from a shell export at startup is left untouched, so an
in-process update never masks a shell variable that wins at runtime.

### File format

`formatEnv` writes managed keys first, in `MANAGED_ENV_KEYS` order, followed by
any other keys sorted alphabetically. Values are always double-quoted and
escaped by `formatEnvValue`, which replaces in a fixed order — backslash first,
then double-quote, then newline, then carriage-return — so the reverse read can
always undo each escape without ambiguity. `parseEnv` reads the file back: it
ignores blank lines and `#` comments, accepts an optional `export ` prefix,
requires shell-style `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` keys, and unescapes double-quoted
values through `parseEnvValue`.

`parseEnvValue` performs unescaping as a **single atomic left-to-right pass**.
It strips the surrounding quotes and replaces each `\\` + character escape with
a single `replace` over `/\\(.)/gsu`, switching on the escaped character
(`n` → newline, `r` → carriage return, `"` → quote, `\` → backslash) and leaving
any other escaped pair intact. This replaced the earlier sequential independent
`replace()` calls, which were unsafe: unescaping `\\n` (an escaped backslash
followed by `n`) back into a raw `\` first and only then scanning for `\n` could
let a later pass re-read that raw backslash plus the next character as a brand
new escape pair. The concrete failure was a Windows path such as
`C:\name\creds.json` — its `\\` + `name` segment would be misread as `\n` +
`ame`, corrupting the value with a real newline. Consuming each backslash
escape as one atomic unit in a single pass closes that window, because no
unescaped output is ever re-scanned.

## Key environment variables

### Provider and model selection

`OPENWIKI_PROVIDER` selects the provider and `OPENWIKI_MODEL_ID` selects the
model. When `OPENWIKI_PROVIDER` is unset, `resolveConfiguredProvider` infers the
provider from whichever credential is present, checking API keys in a fixed order
(`OPENAI_API_KEY`, then OpenAI-compatible, OpenRouter, Anthropic, Baseten,
Fireworks, Nebius, NVIDIA, then Bedrock access/secret keys) and falling back to
`DEFAULT_PROVIDER` (`openai`). Each provider declares its own credential env
variables and optional base-URL override in `PROVIDER_CONFIGS`; see
[Model providers](../concepts/model-providers.md) for the full registry.

### Token limits

OpenWiki caps per-request output tokens through three settings, resolved by
`resolveConfiguredMaxOutputTokens`. The precedence has one provider-specific
exception before the neutral rule:

1. **OpenRouter legacy cap.** When the provider is `openrouter` **and**
   `OPENWIKI_OPENROUTER_MAX_TOKENS` is set, that value is used immediately — it
   wins even over the provider-neutral `OPENWIKI_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS`, so existing
   low-balance installations keep their provider-specific credit limit. This is
   a legacy cap retained because, without one, OpenRouter's credit pre-check
   budgets the model's full advertised output ceiling and rejects requests with
   HTTP 402.
2. **Provider-neutral cap.** Otherwise `OPENWIKI_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS` is parsed by
   `resolveMaxOutputTokens`, which accepts only a positive safe integer (no
   fractions, exponents, or hex). When set, it applies to every other provider.
3. **Bedrock default.** When the neutral setting is also unset and the provider
   is `bedrock`, `OPENWIKI_BEDROCK_MAX_TOKENS` caps output for the Bedrock
   Converse API. `resolveBedrockMaxTokens` **defaults to
   `BEDROCK_DEFAULT_MAX_TOKENS` (16000)** when unset, matching
   `@langchain/anthropic`'s built-in ceiling for Claude models — without an
   explicit `maxTokens`, Bedrock caps output at 4096 tokens and truncates long
   wiki pages mid-write. Override it for models with a lower ceiling.
4. When all of the above are unset and the provider is not `bedrock`, the resolved
   cap is `undefined` and the provider SDK's own default applies (Bedrock always
   gets the 16000 default).

In short: on OpenRouter, `OPENWIKI_OPENROUTER_MAX_TOKENS` (if set) overrides
everything; otherwise `OPENWIKI_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS` (if set) applies to all
providers; otherwise Bedrock gets its 16000 default and every other provider gets
`undefined`.

### Streaming and Responses API toggles

For the `openai-compatible` provider, three independent boolean toggles control
transport and capability, each true only when the value trims to `"true"`:

- `OPENWIKI_OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_USE_RESPONSES_API`
  (`resolveOpenAiCompatibleUseResponsesApi`) routes generation through the OpenAI
  Responses API instead of chat completions.
- `OPENWIKI_OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_STREAMING` (`resolveOpenAiCompatibleStreaming`)
  forces the SSE streaming HTTP transport for every generation, for gateways that
  only serve streaming and otherwise fail silently with blank output.
- `OPENWIKI_OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_REASONING_EFFORT_SUPPORTED`
  (`resolveOpenAiCompatibleReasoningEffortSupported`) is the opt-in that gates
  whether the `openai-compatible` provider supports reasoning effort at all; see
  [Reasoning effort](#reasoning-effort) below.

A separate, distinct axis is `OPENWIKI_OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_STREAM_MESSAGES`
(`resolveOpenAiCompatibleStreamMessages`), which controls how LangGraph surfaces
a run in the TUI ("messages" stream mode) rather than the HTTP transport.

`OPENWIKI_STREAM_IDLE_TIMEOUT` sets the milliseconds to wait for the first or
next Bedrock stream chunk; `resolveStreamIdleTimeoutForProvider` applies it only
to the `bedrock` provider, and a value of `0` disables the stream watchdog
entirely (stalled streams may then hang indefinitely).

`OPENWIKI_PAGE_CONCURRENCY` (`resolvePageConcurrency`) sets how many
repository page workers may run at once, accepting an integer from 1 to
`MAX_PAGE_CONCURRENCY` (8) and defaulting to `DEFAULT_PAGE_CONCURRENCY` (1) when
unset. Concurrent workers share one provider key, so they make transient rate
limits the common failure; the upper bound keeps a single key from being
rate-limit bound and keeps the progress view readable.

`OPENWIKI_PROVIDER_RETRY_ATTEMPTS` (`resolveProviderRetryAttempts`) sets the
provider retry count as a positive integer. An explicit value always wins. When
unset, the default adapts to the run's page concurrency: a single-worker run
gets `DEFAULT_PROVIDER_RETRY_ATTEMPTS` (3), while a concurrent run (more than
one page worker) gets `PARALLEL_PROVIDER_RETRY_ATTEMPTS` (5), because
concurrent workers make transient rate limits the common failure and need more
headroom.

### Reasoning effort

`OPENWIKI_REASONING_EFFORT` selects a reasoning effort from
`REASONING_EFFORT_VALUES` (`none`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max`).
`resolveReasoningConfig` returns `undefined` when the variable is unset, but
throws when it is set to an invalid value, when the selected provider/model has
no reasoning capability, or when the value is outside the values that
capability supports. Reasoning capability is declared per provider and model in
`REASONING_CAPABILITIES`, and each capability also carries the transport used to
send it.

`REASONING_CAPABILITIES` declares three transports, each sent differently by
the agent's model constructor:

- **`responses-reasoning`** — OpenAI GPT-5.6 models on the `openai` and
  `openai-chatgpt` providers (and `openai-compatible` when the Responses-API
  opt-in is also set). Effort is sent as the Responses `reasoning.effort` payload.
- **`chat-completions-reasoning-effort`** — NVIDIA NIM, and `openai-compatible`
  when reasoning effort is opted in but the Responses API is not in use. Effort
  is sent as the chat-completions `reasoning_effort` kwarg.
- **`gemini-thinking-level`** — `gemini-3.6-flash` on the `gemini` provider.
  Effort is sent as the Gemini `thinkingLevel` option.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  E["OPENWIKI_REASONING_EFFORT set"] --> R["resolveReasoningConfig"]
  R --> C{"getReasoningCapability"}
  C -- "openai / openai-chatgpt GPT-5.6" --> RR["responses-reasoning\nreasoning.effort"]
  C -- "nvidia NIM, openai-compatible (no Responses)" --> CC["chat-completions-reasoning-effort\nreasoning_effort kwarg"]
  C -- "gemini-3.6-flash" --> GT["gemini-thinking-level\nthinkingLevel"]
  C -- "openai-compatible, opt-in unset" --> U["unsupported → throws"]
```

For the `openai-compatible` provider specifically, reasoning effort is disabled
unless `OPENWIKI_OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_REASONING_EFFORT_SUPPORTED` is set to `true`.
`getOpenAiCompatibleReasoningCapability` returns `undefined` when that opt-in is
absent (so `resolveReasoningConfig` throws "not supported"), and otherwise picks
the transport from the Responses-API toggle: `responses-reasoning` when
`OPENWIKI_OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_USE_RESPONSES_API` is set, otherwise
`chat-completions-reasoning-effort`. It supports the full
`REASONING_EFFORT_VALUES` set regardless of transport. The Gemini capability
(`gemini-3.6-flash`) supports only `low`/`medium`/`high`, and the NVIDIA NIM
capability supports only `none`/`low`/`high`, so a value like `max` is rejected
for those models even though it is valid for OpenAI GPT-5.6.

## Credential diagnostics

`getCredentialDiagnostics` produces one `CredentialDiagnostic` per key in
`CREDENTIAL_DIAGNOSTIC_ENV_KEYS`, comparing the file value against the
`process.env` value. Each entry reports its source — `process.env`, the env file
path, "process.env over <file>" when both are set, or `unset` — and a
masked preview. Non-secret settings (provider, model, token limits, page concurrency, retry
attempts, base URLs, region, Google project/location, OpenRouter provider-only filter, and
the boolean toggles, including `OPENWIKI_OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_STREAM_MESSAGES` and
`OPENWIKI_OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_REASONING_EFFORT_SUPPORTED`) are shown verbatim;
true secrets are previewed as a short masked fragment (or all-asterisks for short
values).

Diagnostics surface per-key warnings through a dedicated validator per key:
invalid provider, invalid model ID, invalid token limits (neutral, Bedrock, and
OpenRouter each have their own validator), invalid boolean, invalid reasoning
effort, invalid retry attempts, invalid page concurrency, invalid stream idle
timeout, base-URL provider mismatches (Anthropic, Baseten, Bob, Fireworks,
NVIDIA, OpenAI, and the OpenAI-compatible base URL each validated through
`getProviderBaseUrlWarnings`), credential
whitespace/newline/quote issues, and a warning that the Bedrock stream watchdog
is disabled when the idle timeout is `0`. The boolean validator
`getBooleanWarnings` covers all four `openai-compatible` toggles —
`OPENWIKI_OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_USE_RESPONSES_API`,
`OPENWIKI_OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_STREAMING`,
`OPENWIKI_OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_STREAM_MESSAGES`, and
`OPENWIKI_OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_REASONING_EFFORT_SUPPORTED` — reporting "invalid
boolean" for any value that does not trim to `true` or `false`.

`OPENWIKI_BEDROCK_MAX_TOKENS` is treated as a **non-secret diagnostic key**: its
value is shown verbatim in the panel and validated by its own
`getBedrockMaxTokensWarnings` validator (which calls `resolveBedrockMaxTokens`
and reports "invalid output token limit" on failure), distinct from the neutral
`getMaxOutputTokensWarnings` and the OpenRouter `getOpenRouterMaxTokensWarnings`
validators.

## Secret sanitization

`sanitizeDiagnosticText` is the security boundary for anything shown to the user
or written to a log: every error message, header value, or provider response body
that could contain a credential must pass through it first. It redacts (1) the
exact values of secrets currently set in the environment, replacing each with
`[REDACTED:<KEY>]`, and (2) anything matching known key/token shapes — OpenAI and
OpenRouter `sk-…` keys, `Bearer …` headers, LangSmith `ls…` tokens, and the
"Incorrect API key provided: …" phrasing. `getErrorMessage` routes user-facing
errors through this sanitizer (with a friendlier message for provider HTTP 500s).

`isSecretLikeKey`, backed by the shared `SECRET_KEY_PATTERN_SOURCE`, is the
single source of truth for deciding whether an object key name looks
secret-bearing (matching `api_key`, `authorization`, `bearer`, `token`,
`secret`, `password`, `user_id`, or `cookie`); every redaction path — diagnostics,
OpenRouter response bodies, and MCP tool args/results — shares it, so a key
redacted by one path is redacted by all. `isAuthError` classifies failures as
credential rejections from HTTP 401/403 status and the already-redacted message,
driving whether the CLI shows the authentication "how to fix" panel.
